# Jacquard - Yarn Translation helper tool

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Take a look  [here](CreateReactAppREADME.md) for that documentation.

### Dependencies

Building/developing this tool requires the following dependencies be pre-installed:

* NodeJS (https://nodejs.org).
* Yarn package manager (https://yarnpkg.com).

First, you need to make sure that you have nodeJs and Yarn installed (see the dependencies section above and install the relevant version for your platform).

Currently we're using `node v8.9.4` and `yarn v1.5.1`.

### Spin up instructions

Using your command line, navigate to the directory you've cloned this repo into.

  1. Execute a `yarn install`. This will download all the necessary libraries you need.
  2. To start a development environment run `yarn start-dev` (this will use formeman to start both the react build system and the electron runtime)

### Build instructions

To build, execute `yarn build` and the built binaries should be in the `dist` directory!
